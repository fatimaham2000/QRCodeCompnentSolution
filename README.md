2- design CSS for each component based on the design's reference

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- How to create media query

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@media (max-width: 375px){
    .container{
        box-shadow: 1px 5px 30px -15px hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    }
    footer{
        padding: 2em 0;
    }
}
```
